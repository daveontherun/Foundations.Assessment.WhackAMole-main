# Whack A Mole

## Unit 03 Assessment

## Overview

You've been assigned to build a brand new feature: a Whack A Mole game to keep users entertained while they're waiting for the rest of the website to load.

This assessment tests your ability to manipulate the DOM and listen for events.

More detailed instructions are on Canvas.

Feel free to edit this README as you see fit!

<!-- Here is how the game operates:

There is a visible score on the screen that starts at 0.
There are 9 holes. Each hole can contain up to one mole.
One mole is generated in a random hole.
Each time the mole is clicked, it moves to another random hole and the score goes up by 1. -->
